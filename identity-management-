n the context of computer security, IAM stands for Identity and Access Management. IAM is a framework of policies, processes, and technologies used to manage digital identities and control access to computing resources, such as applications, data, and services.

IAM systems are used to ensure that only authorized individuals and systems are granted access to the resources they need to perform their duties. IAM solutions typically involve the use of tools such as authentication, authorization, and auditing to manage user access and permissions.
